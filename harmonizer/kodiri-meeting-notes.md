# Kodiri meeting notes (_Thursday 26 Sep 2019_)

## Context
> Kodiri is a website offering unit test-based exercises to learn web development. In summer of 2019 they contacted ReDI School and had a call with Manuel and Eric. The React course has used Kodiri's React exercises (after "codesandboxing" them) with good feedback from students solving them. A follow-up meeting took place with Eric and Ricardo (from Kodiri) present to catch up and look at how further collaboration might be done.

## Take-aways

- Interesting discussion about how to approach teaching React. Kodiri basically requires you to read unit tests to understand precisely what are the requirements to the code you write to solve exercises. In the React course we decided to "codesandbox-ize" exercises for two reasons: (a) give students a visual output of the React code they write, and (b) make it optional to read the unit tests - instead, we basically convert the unit test into a small "requirements specification", saying your code should to X, Y and Z. Check any of the exercises in the repo to get an idea.
- Kodiri to look at recycling what React course has done. Perhaps let Kodiri users choose between two modes, "visual" and "unit test".
- Kodiri to give us a complete dump of all Kodiri React exercises. That'll help us automatize codesandbox-ization of their exercises (currently takes 15-25 minutes of teacher time per exercises)
- Ricardo demoed different features of the platform and invited ReDI to see how might be used. These include:
  * a) Competitions: Kodiri runs competitions, they did one with England vs. Spain vs. France. We could look at including ReDI as a "Germany team" some other time they run a competition
  * b) Self-created exercises: we have access to upload our own exercises to Kodiri and can give sets of them to students. We can use Kodiri-made exercises in these sets. This can be great to create exercises for our students that are more like we want them. Then solving them in Kodiri, as opposed to Codesandbox, provides the advantage of the unit test output in Kodiri being more friendly to read. Oh, and we can also track student progress.
