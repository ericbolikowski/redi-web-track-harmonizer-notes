# Meeting notes, meeting of **ReDI Web Track Harmonizers**

## _Monday 28 Oct 2019_

Attendees: Flaco from the HTML/CSS course, Carlo from the JS course, Eric from the React course.

Aims of the Web Track Harmonizers:

- A holistic Web Track curriculum
- Continuity from class to class

### News from each course

#### HTML/CSS

- Best semester so far.
- Success with "Website Wars": 1-2 week mini-projects, students alone or in groups compete to create websites.
- Plenty of teachers, several have taught through several semesters, team is well-oiled.

#### JS

- Students report a lack of exercises.

#### React

- Also best semester so far.
- Doesn't use slides in courses. This can be improved and the course can learn from other courses in how to do this.
- Using unit test-driven exercises from Kodiri to teach React have worked out well. It needs to be however balanced with more open-ended exercises.

### Specific recommendations

1. **Course Admission Fast-Track**:
   Admit students directly into the next course (i.e. from HTML/CSS to JS, and from JS to React). Criteria: student has to (a) meet the technical prerequisites of the next course, and (b) be sufficiently motivated to continue in the next course.
   _Action_: at end of semester, Harmonizers to make HTML/CSS and JS course teachers make a list of students who want to continue studying in the track.
   _Action_: Eric to coordinate with Fadi.

2. **Highlight Web Track value proposition on website**:
   Consider adding personal short interviews of students to the Web Track section on the ReDI School website. Interviews designed to explain how what they learnt in the web track got them a job.
   _Action_: Eric to ask Carys.

### Actionable recommendations for Web Track initiatives

1. **Open Study Sessions**:
   Web Track teachers to organize open study sessions for any student in the track. Study sessions to be organized in January/February when courses aren't running. If this works well, we could perhaps continue with open study sessions during the semester itself as well.
   _Action_: towards end of the semester, Harmonizers to find interested teachers from each course.

2. **Collaboration across track courses on projects**:
   Student projects finished in one class can be the starting point for student projects in the next course. E.g. convert a 'non-interactive' HTML/CSS project into an interactive site by adding JS.
   _Action_: Carlo+Flaco and Carlo+Eric to coordinate JS and React courses receiving restaurant website projects from HTML/CSS course.
3. **Catch-up workshops at beginning of semester**:
   As necessary, JS course and React course can organize 'catch-up workshops' either right before semester start or at start of semester, to fill the gaps in students' knowledge of course prerequisites.
   _Action_: all Harmonizers to make teachers aware of this.
4. **Ad-hoc topic-specific workshops**:
   Teachers should continuously check/ask students to spot specific topics in the web track curriculum that needs to be refreshed. For instance, if there are React students who'd like a refresher on CSS animations, a workshop can be organized by teachers from the HTML/CSS course open for React students (as well as JS students).
   Workshops can also be organized on topics not strictly speaking in the curriculum. For example, a React teacher once organized three workshops on the topic of unit testing.
   _Action_: all Harmonizers to make teachers aware of this.
5. **Student evaluation workshop**:
   Towards end of semester, find 2-3 students from each course to participate in an evaluation workshop. Purpose: identify gaps between the Web Track courses. Update course curriculums accordingly.
   _Action_: Eric to remind to resume topic mid-November in Harmonizer group.
6. **Slides templates**:
   HTML/CSS course are moving slides into a new template. This can be especially useful for React course that doesn't use slides so far.
   _Action_: Flaco to share template with other courses via Carlo and Eric.
7. **Kodiri use in track**:
   Students in the JS course have reported a lack of exercises, so Kodiri can be a good source of exercises for them. Each Kodiri exercise runs based on unit tests, which isn't ideal for ReDI students. The React course has cloned + improved the Kodiri exercises (using Codesandbox). We could do the same for the JS course.
   _Action_: Eric to ask Kodiri for a .json file containing a dump of their JS exercises.
