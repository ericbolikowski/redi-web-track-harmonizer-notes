# Meeting notes, meeting of **ReDI Web Track Harmonizers**

## _Monday 28 Oct 2019_

Attendees: Flaco from the HTML/CSS course, Carlo from the JS course, Eric from the React course.

Meeting purpose:

### News from each course

#### HTML/CSS

#### JS

#### React

### Specific recommendations

1. **Course Admission Fast-Track**:
   Admit students directly into the next course (i.e. from HTML/CSS to JS, and from JS to React). Criteria: student has to (a) meet the technical prerequisites of the next course, and (b) be sufficiently motivated to continue in the next course.
   _Action_: at end of semester, Harmonizers to make HTML/CSS and JS course teachers make a list of students who want to continue studying in the track.
   _Action_: Eric to coordinate with Fadi.

2. **Highlight Web Track value proposition on website**:
   Consider adding personal short interviews of students to the Web Track section on the ReDI School website. Interviews designed to explain how what they learnt in the web track got them a job.
   _Action_: Eric to ask Carys.

### Actionable recommendations for Web Track initiatives

1. **Open Study Sessions**:
   Web Track teachers to organize open study sessions for any student in the track. Study sessions to be organized in January/February when courses aren't running. If it's a success, perhaps continue with open study sessions during the semester itself as well.
   _Action_: towards end of the semester, Harmonizers to find interested teachers from each course.

2. **Collaboration across track courses on projects**:
   Projects finished by one class can be handed over to students in the next course for enhancement. E.g. convert a 'non-interactive' HTML/CSS project into an interactive site by adding JS.
   _Action_: Carlo+Flaco and Carlo+Eric to coordinate JS and React courses receiving restaurant website projects from HTML/CSS course.
3. **Catch-up workshops at beginning of semester**:
   As necessary, JS course and React course can organize 'catch-up workshops' either right before semester start or at start of semester, to fill the gaps in students' knowledge of the course prerequisite.
   _Action_: all Harmonizers to make teachers aware of this.
4. **Ad-hoc topic-specific workshops**:
   Teachers should continuously check/ask students to spot specific topics in the web track curriculum that needs to be refreshed. For instance, if there are React students who'd like a refresher on CSS animations, a workshop can be organized by teachers from the HTML/CSS course open for React students (as well as JS students).
   Workshops can also be organized on topics not strictly speaking in the curriculum. For example, a React teacher once organized three workshops on the topic of unit testing.
   _Action_: all Harmonizers to make teachers aware of this.
5. **Student evaluation workshop**:

### Follow-ups

- **Eric**: check interest in React course for:
  - workshop on a HTML/CSS topic
  - as final project continue working on Restaurant website project handed off from HTML/CSS course
- **Carlo/Eric**: organize visit from React course to JS course
- **Flaco/Carlo**: organize visit from JS course to HTML course
- **Flaco/Carlo**: coordinate potential project of JS students enhancing restaurant website projects handed off from HTML/CSS course
- **Eric**: mid-November again raise the topic of a 'Student Evaluation Workshop' + Open Study Sessions
- **Eric**: follow up with ReDI staff where relevant
