# ReDI Harmonizer Spy 007 - Mission Report

## **2019-09-05**: JavaScript class visit

## Purpose of this document

> summarize teaching methodology used in class to extract best practices for re-use in other classes or courses

## Class structure:

- Quiz by Sevtap shown on projector. Solving questions Q&A-style with students. Exercise types:
  a) Show a series of code snippets. For each snippet, ask whether it is valid code or invalid code.
  b) Show 4-5 code snippets all meant to do the same thing. Ask whether the snippets are really doing the same thing.
  c) State a problem and show two proposed solutions. Everybody: compare & contrast solutions, determine if solutions are valid or not.
  d) State some programming problems. Everybody: write a solution together.
  e) List Javascript keywords, ask students to define them (_e.g. if statement, block, condition, function, nesting, console.log_).

## Observations

- Quiz technique is a new idea being tested in this class.
- One student who transitioned from the JS course to the React course had forgotten a lot of javascript in the time between the classes and was struggling to recall the necessary theory.
  - Potential idea for React course: before the React course, run a one-week catch-up boot-camp covering Javascript prerequisites.
- Extra optional workshops along the semester to address particular concepts and questions that are extra-curricular.

## Typical challenges in course

- Students are generally "shy" at the start of the semester and don't ask questions in class or on Slack. How can we "break the ice" quicker?

## General structure of Javascript classes:

- Theory
- Exercise
- Possibly more exercise
- Closing exercise
  Questions in-between. Structure varies a bit with what the class topic it is.

Later in the semester students do much more hands-on exercises and less theory is taught.

## Teaching principles

- Use projector to make everyone write code together (Q&A-style, ask students actively)
- Reinforcement learning: use the quiz to recap theory from previous class
- Interactive projector coding (_e.g. a simple JsBin - text field to input hex code, button to trigger setting the inputted colour as body background colour_)
