# ReDI Harmonizer Spy 007 - Mission Report

## **2019-09-17**: HTML/CSS class visit

## Purpose of this document

> summarize teaching methodology used in class to extract best practices for re-use in other classes or courses

## Class structure

1. 1850-1900 Students arrive
2. 1905-1945 Theory/lecture (e.g. CSS positioning)
3. 1945-2010 Exercises
4. 2010-2020 Break (only 3-4 students took it, the rest did exercises)
5. 2020-2100 Lecture

## Observations

- Slides with good theory. Slides have been used from semester to semester. They're improved every semester. One slide / HTML file per concept. Order in which concepts are taught has been changed.
- Preventing pandora's box from opening: "_I wish we could cover all of these topics in class but we simply don't have the time_"

> For the next two classes you'll be split up into teams. We the teachers have made some websites. You'll re-construct the websites.

## Teaching principles

- Speak from the gut!

  > This is tricky shit. Switching this CSS like this fucks your layout up. This fucks you up.
  > What a good question. You son of a bitch.
  > You can make your site do incredible shit.
  > Take a look at your websites and just fuck around with them.
  > You better bring your ass to class on fucking time. We won't wait around for you.
  > Now get the fuck out of here!

- Teachers ask "control questions" to students.

- Use Chrome DevTools to show in-real-time how changing CSS properties works
